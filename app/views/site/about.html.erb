      Simplicity and efficiency is at the heart of everything I do at Pokrex.
      It utilizes clean UI and intuitive interactions to make it make estimating easier. The original thought of building up this tool, is because the network environment in China sucks, most of the tools we were using ain't working smoothly. Then I started to create one.

      Pokrex is a completely free service and all your suggestions and criticism are welcomed!.
